    <p>A lonely soul dug into the earth as she stares into the eyes of her loved ones<br><br>
    She sees them as clear as the body of water sitting beside her. 
    <br><br>
    Helping; healing as it comes as her sixth sense.
    <br><br>
    She dances with the wind, leaves blowing and swaying with her as her spirit strengthens.  
    A lonely soul dug into the earth as she stares into the eyes of her loved ones 
    <br><br>  
    She sees them as clear as the body of water sitting beside her. 
    <br><br>  
    Helping; healing as it comes as her sixth sense.
    <br><br>  
    She dances with the wind, leaves blowing and swaying with her as her spirit strengthens.  
    <br><br>  
    How amazing is it to have ‘she.’ What a charm to come across. A four-leaf clover. 
    <br><br>  
    Except she’s a force of nature. As you arrive closer you can notice cuts and scrapes where they attempted to tear her down.
    <br><br>
    But still she stands strongly and tall buried into her mother earth.
    <br><br>
    Energy overworking the body as people come to speak to her. 
    <br><br>
    Without saying a word, she can catch an entire glimpse of their life. 
    <br><br>
    Nonetheless they share their deepest thoughts, their most personal and loved creations with her. 
    <br><br>
    She knows exactly how to make someone feel like their body holds the brightest star in the sky. 
    <br><br>
    As the night arrives closer and colder the people pack up their things and get ready to go. 
    <br><br>
    As any energy is failed to be returned back to her she asks herself why can’t anyone see she’s there too. 
    <br><br>
    She pleads to be seen, to be appreciated for the energy she freely gives away.
    <br><br>
    Is this a charm or just for the people around her?
    <br><br>
    A curse was born with her, residing in her soul. 
    <br><br>
    As the night grows, she feels even more alone than before. 
    <br><br>
    She’s sick of not being seen, heard or understood
    <br><br>
    When people came to see her the next day they noticed something different about her. Her leaves were closed instead of spread.
    <br><br>
    They question her as to why she’s being inconsiderate. As if her containing her energy is an act of selfishness. 
    <br><br>
    “Im here too.”

    My fingers trickle across their skin bursting tenderness 
    <br><br>
Warmth fills from my cheeks all the way down to my toes 
<br><br>
This bewildering feeling is what keeps me Alive
<br><br>
A starseed finding her way 
<br><br>
Made entirely of love ; willing to share.
<br><br>
Fingers belonging to other bodies
<br><br>
Tracing their fuming steam over her soft skin
<br><br>
Burning her ; leaving marks like cigarette burns 
<br><br>
Instead of sharing a breath with her
<br><br>
They breathe it all in ; taking it all for themselves 
<br><br>
Leaving her breathless
<br><br>
Gasping for air as the Love gets sucked out of her form 
<br><br>
Looking for her way in this dark planet 
<br><br>
Attempting to dodge the demons disguised as angels looking to steal her soul and power all for themselves;
<br><br>
At length she sees a star , far from reach 
<br><br>
Could this finally be? 
<br><br>
A soul that will touch her gently;
<br><br>
With care
<br><br>
Another embodiment of love

    <p>Biting into a cold strawberry
      <br><br>
      On a hot summer day
      <br><br>
      Sweat running down;
      <br><br>
      As my mouth fills with that sweet and sour taste
      <br><br>
      Being with you
      <br><br>
      Still a little scary. 
      <br><br>
      But this fear is worth all of our memories
      <br><br>
      Even after facing all of this treachery 
      <br><br>
      I look into your eyes 
      <br><br>
      And my stomach feels all feathery
      <br><br>
      Just like running in the sand 
      <br><br>
      On a perfectly hot day 
      <br><br>
      Hearing the waves crashing;
      <br><br>
      Music to my ears. 
      <br><br>
      You make all my bad days disappear </p>

    <p>sweet and short lived 
      <br><br>
      The flowers bloomed and the leaves grew
      <br><br>
      Hearing the birds chirping and the crickets singing
      <br><br>
      We laughed and smiled 
      <br><br>
      And like the wind we blew
      <br><br>
      Sweet and short lived 
      <br><br>
      How I wish for this season to last
      <br><br>
      But eventually the petals and the leaves fell
      <br><br>
      And the birds migrated with the crickets
      <br><br>
      And soon there was nothing left
      <br><br>
      And like the wind we disappeared </p>
