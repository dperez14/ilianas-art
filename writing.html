    <p>A lonely soul dug into the earth as she stares into the eyes of her loved ones<br><br>
    She sees them as clear as the body of water sitting beside her. 
    <br><br>
    Helping; healing as it comes as her sixth sense.
    <br><br>
    She dances with the wind, leaves blowing and swaying with her as her spirit strengthens.  
    A lonely soul dug into the earth as she stares into the eyes of her loved ones 
    <br><br>  
    She sees them as clear as the body of water sitting beside her. 
    <br><br>  
    Helping; healing as it comes as her sixth sense.
    <br><br>  
    She dances with the wind, leaves blowing and swaying with her as her spirit strengthens.  
    <br><br>  
    How amazing is it to have ‘she.’ What a charm to come across. A four-leaf clover. 
    <br><br>  
    Except she’s a force of nature. As you arrive closer you can notice cuts and scrapes where they attempted to tear her down.
    <br><br>
    But still she stands strongly and tall buried into her mother earth.
    <br><br>
    Energy overworking the body as people come to speak to her. 
    <br><br>
    Without saying a word, she can catch an entire glimpse of their life. 
    <br><br>
    Nonetheless they share their deepest thoughts, their most personal and loved creations with her. 
    <br><br>
    She knows exactly how to make someone feel like their body holds the brightest star in the sky. 
    <br><br>
    As the night arrives closer and colder the people pack up their things and get ready to go. 
    <br><br>
    As any energy is failed to be returned back to her she asks herself why can’t anyone see she’s there too. 
    <br><br>
    She pleads to be seen, to be appreciated for the energy she freely gives away.
    <br><br>
    Is this a charm or just for the people around her?
    <br><br>
    A curse was born with her, residing in her soul. 
    <br><br>
    As the night grows, she feels even more alone than before. 
    <br><br>
    She’s sick of not being seen, heard or understood
    <br><br>
    When people came to see her the next day they noticed something different about her. Her leaves were closed instead of spread.
    <br><br>
    They question her as to why she’s being inconsiderate. As if her containing her energy is an act of selfishness. 
    <br><br>
    “Im here too.”
